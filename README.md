# TreeLeaf_Complete

This repository contains various projects and experiments completed during my internship and other work. Below is an overview of the key folders and their contents.

## Folder Descriptions

### `tesseractTesseract`
This folder contains the final training work for Tesseract OCR. It includes all the files and configurations used during the training process.

### `LiscencePlateRecognition`
This folder contains work related to fine-tuning OCR models, including:
- **EasyOCR**: A comprehensive fine-tuning process.
- **ResNet**: A customized ResNet model fine-tuned for license plate recognition.

### `CustomOCR`
This folder includes a **custom OCR** system that I developed during my internship. It demonstrates a tailor-made approach to OCR for specific use cases.

### `TreeleafWorkFiles`
This folder comprises a variety of tasks and models, including:
- **Inference with Pretrained Models**: Implementation and testing of models.
- **Tesseract Training**: Training Tesseract OCR, specifically inside the folder `TesseractLinux`.
- **Image Annotation**: Annotation of select images for training purposes.
- **Inference of GOT-OCR2.0**: Using the GOT-OCR2.0 pretrained model for inference tasks.
